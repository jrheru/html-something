                    <p>First I want to give a shout to the greats that paved the way for the generation after them. Music has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, I love all genres but what is closest to my heart is what I grew up on, and that my friend is rap music. There is always a debate on who ist he G.O.A.T, that is probably going to be a debate until the end of time. Really there is no best, people like to hear what they can relate to, who they grew up on, and who they look up to. So instead of going with the mundane best rapper of all time list, which I could not tell you honestly. I do not have time to create that list, or to defend it. So instead I will just go with who has been the most influential in the game since I became a student of the game. And to add some suspense I will go backwards from 5 to 1, so get your popcorn ready and let the debate begin.</p>

                    <p>Long ago there was a time when Eminem could not be stopped, from The Slim Shady LP to The Eminem Show, Slim shady was on fire. He was something I never seen before, a white rapper cosigned by Dr. Dre and lyrically a monster. My personal favorite was The Marshall Mathers LP dropped in 2000. Its hard to believe that Mr. Mathers is 47 now. He was once in discussion for greatest of all time, but then Kendrick Lamar came out and well you know. But Eminem had a great career. I personally stopped listening to him after Encore in 2004 but you can say he had a nice 5-7 year run and his last album was dropped in 2018 Kamikaze. The reason he is only 5 on my list and not higher, is besides his controversial music and the 8 miles movie he did not really do much outside of hip hop to influence the culture. Em was nice though!</p>

                    <p>Weezy F. Baby been in the game for a while, at the age 12 he was discovered by his weird once father like figure Baby. At 37 he deserves a lifetime achievement award for the work he has put in. I would personally call him the mixtape king and only Gucci Mane can challenge him for that title.  I remember when he first called himself the best rapper alive, and this was when Jay-Z was still running the game. I thought he was crazy, but with underground lyrical classics like Dedication and mainstream successful albums like The Carter 2 and 3, Lil Wayne proved to be one of the best lyrical rappers of our generation and his style influenced a whole bunch of artist behind him. He was even a mentor to two other big artist under his Young Money label, Drake and Nicki Minaj.  And though he is on the back 9 of his career I don’t think we’ll every see another Lil Wayne!</p>

                                <p>Oh when the student becomes the teacher. Piggybacking off the number 4 most influential rap artist is the number 3 artist Drizzy Drake. Drake has been on the but end of jokes ever since he came into the game because his style was so different. He sang and rapped which was not unusual within its self but Drake had a way of putting it all together. And from 2010-2019 Drake has been a dominate figure on the charts. How dominate you ask? Well Drake has more top 10 singles than the Beatles! Come on man, thats just ridiculous, now how many rap singers you see out here today? I guess Drake has had the last laugh. Even people that do not listen to rap know who Drake is! Go ahead ask your granny who is Drake.</p>

                            <p>Do I really have to say anything about this fellow? I know before  Jesus is King and MAGA hats, there was Jesus Walks and Taylor Swift rants. Kanye have been all over the place. The self proclaimed greatest living artist, and in history might not be too off his rocker. From music production, to his reality show famous wife, or his hard to get sneaker line Kanye has been a mainstay and interesting figure in the game. He is a hot topic button one way or another and once its all said and done he might go down as the greatest artist of all time, not just rapper.</p>

                        <p>Last but not least is the first billionaire rapper, Jigga!  At this point Jay-Z might be the culture, and to me his best album was the first Blue Print in 2001. But no rapper has had more mainstream success in the game than Jay-Z. I think at one point he had 8 platinum albums in a row. As he once famously said I am not a business man, I am a BUSINESS MAN ever so poetically. And he has proven that every step of the way. That is not to mention his wife is Beyonce, they are truly hip hop royalty. He even talked the NFL to give Colin Kaepernick a tryout after 3 years of being blackballed, now that’s real influence!</p>
