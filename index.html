                    <p>Around eight years ago, something happened to me that would change my life forever. It happened almost fours after another life changing event. On November 19, 2007 I sustained a spinal cord injury while working out at a local gym. The doctors told me I would never walk again, and that I would not be able have kids. It was two weeks before my 22nd birthday, I was devastated and could not control my emotions, he might as well gave me my death sentence, because I didn not know how I would live on being in a wheelchair and losing my independence. The first year after the injury was rough I lost my girlfriend, my apartment, and a close relative who died at the age of 17. I can not tell you how I survived it, and to tell you the truth it is all just a blur to me now a days. But four years after that faithful day a miracle happened, on December 03, 2011 my son was born. Just three days before my 26th birthday.</p>

                    <p>He was my first child and still my only child til this day. To think the doctors told me just four years earlier that I would not be able to have kids, so I was shocked to say the least. But sure enough I was a father for the first time. And what was meant to be joyful occasion turned into a dire situation real fast. When my son was born the doctors discovered he had brain malformation and had to stay in the NICU for the first couple of months of his life. He suffered from seizures, at one point he had over 10 a day. So at two months old me and his mother had to make probably the hardest decision of our lives. Either keep him on the seziure medication that was not working or opt for brain surgery. We opted for the surgery and he was one of the youngest patients to have brain surgery in the history of that hospital. The surgery was a success, but it was not without a cost. With it my son developed autism, partial cerebral palsy, and pica. It is hard enough to be a father, there is no manual out on how to raise a child and yet here I was a father with a disability about to raise a special needs child. </p>

                    <p>Eight years later my son is alive and well. There were a lot of sleepless nights, as it would be for any child. But we made it through and he is now walking and is in school. That is a miracle to me, especially when some nights I did not if he was going to make it or not. I still worry sometimes and have anxiety about our future, as would any parent. But for now I just enjoy our time together and through our experiences learn to be a better person. He has taught me a lot of things about compassion, understanding, and patience. He is both my anchor and inspiration.  I can go on about our story, but the story it is not over yet. I still have a lot to learn, about myself and life in general but I know he is going to be one of my greatest teachers. And hopefully along the way he learn a thing or two from me as well. He is my heart, and throughout everything he has been through, what we both been through, that will never change. He will also be the twinkle in my eye.</p>
